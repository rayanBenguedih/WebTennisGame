# Web Tennis Game


This is a simple implementation using html and node.js to make a small tennis game simulation.

# How to use

Open a terminal in the folder and type in:
npm install

Then, type:
node app.js

This will run the server.


Go on localhost/:3000

Insert the player's name and player's levels

It'll redirect you to two buttons with a summary of the players

Click on "Get Result" to get results that will generate 150 points
click on "Send Result" to send the results to the backend.

In order to repeat the process, you'll need to generate new results each time yourself pressing the button.
